message: "I'm happy to welcome you! \r\n \r\nSending newsletters via  forms of Your offers into the \"Contact us\" section to the sites of firms via any countries and domain zones of the world.  \r\n \r\nwebsite =» xn----7sbb1bbndheurc1a.xn--p1ai \r\n \r\nWHAT IS THE MAILING OF WEBSITES BY FEEDBACK FORMS? \r\nThis is a type of mailing using the feedback forms that are located in the contact section of the website and filled by our robot automatically with a rate of a few thousand feedback forms per 1 minute, while the alphabetic and numeric code from the pictures (CAPTCHA) is also solved. \r\nAfter that, the messages including your cooperation offers are sent to the e-mail addresses of businesses. \r\nWhen sending mailing by contact feedback forms, it turns out that each internet resource sends an e-mail “to itself” and, therefore, all letters arrive in the inbox folder of the exact e-mail in which the organisation is ready to receive the commercial information. \r\n \r\nUnique Trade Offer: \r\nFast one hundred % informing of firms and website owners about new offers. \r\nSearch of new customers that other advertisements cannot find. \r\n \r\nAIM: \r\nFinding customers that cannot be found through other types of advertisements. \r\n \r\nBenefits: \r\n1.one hundred percent delivery of commercial offers. \r\n2.Increase of the customer database. \r\n3. Increase of the your market share. \r\n4.Regionality and topic orientated mailings. \r\n5. Sending information to company officials. \r\n6. Conducting tenders. \r\n7. Conducting marketing research. \r\n8. Conducting surveys and studying public opinion. \r\n9. Notification speed. \r\n10. Cost. \r\n11. Entering the markets of other countries. \r\n \r\nOur competitive advantages: \r\n1.When sending mailing by feedback forms, all e-mails arrive in the inbox. When sending bulk e-mails, this can reach up to 5%. \r\n \r\n2.When sending mailing by contact forms it is possible to send a few million messages per 24 hours to inbox folders. When sending mass e-mails a few thousands arrive in the inbox folders, all the rest often either are not delivered or fill the spam folder. \r\n \r\n3. When sending mailing by feedback forms a letter does not get blocked by mail services because it is sent from different websites. When sending bulk e-mails it is possible to send a few thousands of those but nevertheless all the IP addresses from which the mailing is done will be in \"BAN\". \r\n \r\n4. When sending mailing by contact forms the minimum number of macro-synonims is used to form text and headings of the letter. When sending mass e-mails, it is necessary to use «macros» (synonyms) for each phrase and create thousands different headings. \r\n \r\n5. Many businesses try to hide their e-mail and only leave a contact form for contacting with them. \r\n \r\n6. When sending bulk e-mails, your cooperation offer can be delivered to every employee of the firm, (which causes discontent) compared to mailing by contact forms where the letter is received at the email specifically set up for business offers. \r\n \r\n7.50% of business electronic addresses are located on free mail systems, they are poorly \"searchable\" by e-mail, but when sending mailing by contact forms through these mail servers, all e-mails are one hundred percent delivered to the recipients. \r\n \r\n8. Only thirty-forty percent of firms are published in the directories within two-three years, and all the rest are already placed in our VOIS databases and are waiting for your business offers. \r\nIt turns out that that emails of businesses from directories are spammed, which means that they will not have such monetisation as when sending mailing by contact forms using our always new WHOIS databases. \r\n \r\n9. Any kind of stop words in the body or headings of the letter can be sent through forms. When sending bulk e-mails, such letters either do not reach the recipient or end up in junk. \r\nThe list of stop words of mail systems includes almost all words and phrases that encourage recipients to take actions. \r\n \r\nApplication: \r\n \r\n1. Increasing the customer base. \r\n2. Quick notification of marketplaces about new offers. \r\n3. Informing company officials. \r\n4.Testing the demand for products and services. \r\n5.

The database of every country also includes all joint organisations from all over the world working with or closely related to this country, for example, diasporas and national communities. \r\nSanctions of mail systems and search engines? \r\nThese mailings are an alternative to sending bulk e-mails, therefore search sanctions and \"Ban\" do not apply to them. \r\nMail service delivers the data of messages to the inbox folder, as it goes through the \"warm e-mail channel\" from the new IP address of the internet resource to the corporate e-mail of the same internet resource. \r\nSimply speaking, these mailings \"live in e-mails\" and mail filters do not react to them, because mails have great trust in communication channels between sites and corporate e-mails. \r\n \r\nOUR DATABASES: \r\nYou can buy our databases separately from the mailing by sending us a message by feedback form. \r\n \r\nMORE THAN TWO THOUSAND WHOIS DATABASES BY DOMAIN ZONES AND COUNTRIES. \r\n \r\nCOLLECTIONS OF DATABASES BY THE MAIN CONTINENTS. \r\n \r\nCOLLECTIONS OF DATABASES BY THE MAIN WORLD LANGUAGES. \r\n \r\nSELECTIONS OF DATABASES BY THE MAIN CMS. \r\n \r\nCOLLECTIONS OF DATABASES BY THE MAIN COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD. \r\n \r\nHOW TO MAKE AN PROMOTIONAL OFFER FOR MAILING BY FEEDBACK FORMS: \r\nThe simplest text + a few headings, the main goal is to interest the future customer, and they will read the rest on your site. \r\nMost likely, all ads on your subject are already on the Internet networks, enter the necessary search requests and choose the most suitable ones. \r\nThe headings are substituted replacing each other from .txt file. \r\nOnly messages in the text form are sent, links are inserted without problems, they are all \"clickable\".
