  It is shocking that despite the highly regulated construction industry,
  freeholders and developers can make money and leave the practical and
  financial consequences of their actions to the lessees without any recourse. 
  Also, the obligatory 10 year ARK warranty that was taken out turned out to not
  be fit for purpose as it excluded the roof (this was a rooftop development!!)
  and any architectural design and building errors. The freeholder (ParkCity
  Ltd) recently took action against the  developers (Manor Vale Lodge Ltd) due
  to its breaches of the lease and the lease was surrendered to them and now,
  after quickly demanding the ground rent, they have put the freehold up for
  auction since there's clearly nothing more to fleece. Meanwhile all the
  lessees can now fork out a small fortune each to get the roof fixed and made
  safe. A very sorry tale!
