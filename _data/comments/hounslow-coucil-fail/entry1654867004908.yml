  I lived at 71 Manor Vale from 1983 to 1991 and was instrumental in forming a
  residents' association in 1985. The blocks had flat roofs which were prone to
  leakage and cold bridging. Maintenance of the block, which was owned by a John
  Crocker, and managed by a company by the name of Morley London & Partners, was
  a low standard and the block suffered form significant backlog maintenance. We
  pulled together almost all of residents, contributed to a fighting fund, and
  after taking court action the freeholder agreed to appoint a new management
  company who's headed by an architect, Alan Lane. The new management was
  immeasurably superior and Alan instigated the construction of the pitched roof
  with underlying insulation with heaters in the cold water tanks. If I
  recollect correctly this was undertaken in ~1986 and leakages, frozen water
  tanks and cold bridging became a matter of history. I clearly recall the
  arrival of the 'A' frames for the roof and that they were quite closely
  spaced, so it came as a surprise when, many years later, I witnessed the
  construction of the roof apartments. Shocking but all too common in London.
  The Manor Vale community was so cohesive in those days and I was sorry to
  leave, I have very happy memories of those times. Manor Vale is an oasis
  amongst the hustle and bustle of the busy local environment and I hope that
  this atrocity is resolved in a fair and just manner.
